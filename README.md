# Getting Started with React 

My first steps in using React to create frontend for my project Ottoman-Archive. 
This is only a temporary repository.

I'm using json-server as a mockup database until I learn how to connect React and PHP projects.
To start the mockup server use command npm run server.

Currently, the project contains the input form, while other views are practically empty.
